# ros_gz_utils

This package is intended to allow integration of ros2 and ignition gazebos with a minimum of configuration items.

## Background
To integrate ros2 and ignition gazebo, the paths to the world file and robot description file must be specified.
Also, when using sensors, it is necessary to bridge ros2 and ignition gazebo topics.
It is time-consuming to make these settings for each robot simulation environment.
Therefore, we have created this package to link ros2 and ignition gazebo.

I am not sure if the linking method we are using in this package is a good method; however, I think it is a good idea.
If you know of a better way to link ros2 and ignition gazebo, please contact us.
